some people (including you) here live in their own fractured versions of reality. you
can see different timelines of events play out in front of your very eyes as others who are fractured to different 
realities perform actions of their own. you may see someone's ghost be killed. that same person will be standing
in front of you again, oblivious to what you have seen. you and many others exists in infinitely many timelines
at once, though you only get to see through one of them.
