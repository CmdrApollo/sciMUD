setting:
a frigid, windswept land of endless night where the sun never shines.
the peoples here have been cast off from the light side of the planet.
once outcasts, they have overcome their circumstances formed small communities
throughout the tundra. there is magic, it is *over*complicated and arcane
at times.
there used to be light on both sides of the planet,
hence why there are ancient ruins and dungeons still littered about the frozen wasteland:
they are relics from a time long since passed.

gameplay:
overworld, towns, npcs, dungeons, monsters, combat, quests, etc.

characters:
stats, skills/traits/perks, hp, mp

quests:
though there is a main questline, it takes a backseat as the player gets
lost in the minutia of living in the tundra, doing busywork and incorporating
into the many small settlements dotted throughout the land.
