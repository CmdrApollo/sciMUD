throughout the tundra. there is magic, it is *over*complicated and arcane
at times.

gameplay:
overworld, towns, npcs, dungeons, monsters, combat, quests, etc.

characters:
stats, skills/traits/perks, hp, mp

quests:
though there is a main questline, it takes a backseat as the player gets
lost in the minutia of living in the tundra, doing busywork and incorporating
into the many small settlements dotted throughout the land.
