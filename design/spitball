setting:
a frigid, windswept land of endless night where the sun never shines.
the peoples here have been cast off from the light side of the planet.
once outcasts, they have overcome their circumstances and formed small communities
throughout the tundra. there is magic, it is *over*complicated and arcane
at times.
there used to be light on both sides of the planet,
hence why there are ancient ruins and dungeons still littered about the frozen wasteland:
they are relics from a time long since passed.

some people (including you) here live in their own fractured versions of reality. you
can see different timelines of events play out in front of your very eyes as others who are fractured to different realities perform actions of their own. you may see someone's ghost be killed. that same person will be standing in front of you again, oblivious to what you have seen. you and many others exists in infinitely many timelines at once, though you
only get to see through one of them.

gameplay:
overworld, towns, npcs, dungeons, monsters, combat, quests, etc.

characters:
stats, skills/traits/perks, hp, mp

quests:
though there is a main questline, it takes a backseat as the player gets
lost in the minutia of living in the tundra, doing busywork and incorporating
into the many small settlements dotted throughout the land.
