setting:
a frigid, windswept land of endless night where the sun never shines.
the peoples here have been cast off from the light side of the planet.
once outcasts, they have overcome their circumstances and formed small communities
throughout the tundra. there is magic, it is *over*complicated and arcane
at times.
there used to be light on both sides of the planet,
hence why there are ancient ruins and dungeons still
littered about the frozen wasteland,
they are relics from a time long since passed.

the "light-siders" are known as the Ashari.

gameplay:
overworld, towns, npcs, dungeons, monsters, combat, quests, etc.
it is possible for players to summon each other to their worlds or possibly invade each others' worlds


characters:
stats, skills/traits/perks, hp, mp

quests:
though there is a main questline, it takes a backseat as the player gets
lost in the minutia of living in the tundra, doing busywork and incorporating
into the many small settlements dotted throughout the land.
