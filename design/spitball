setting:
a frigid, windswept land of endless night where the sun never shines.
the peoples here have been cast off from the light side of the planet.
once outcasts, they have overcome their circumstances and formed small communities
throughout the tundra. there is magic, it is *over*complicated and arcane
at times.
there used to be light on both sides of the planet,
hence why there are ancient ruins and dungeons still littered about the frozen wasteland:
they are relics from a time long since passed.

people here live in their own fractured version of reality, in which they
can see different timelines of events play out in front of their very eyes. they may see
someone get killed who in the next second is standing in front of them again, oblivious
to what you have seen. people exists in infinitely many timelines at once, though you
only get to see through one of them.

gameplay:
overworld, towns, npcs, dungeons, monsters, combat, quests, etc.

characters:
stats, skills/traits/perks, hp, mp

quests:
though there is a main questline, it takes a backseat as the player gets
lost in the minutia of living in the tundra, doing busywork and incorporating
into the many small settlements dotted throughout the land.
