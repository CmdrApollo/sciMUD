setting:
a frigid, windswept land of endless night where the sun never shines.
the peoples here have been cast off from the light side of the planet.
once outcasts, they have overcome their circumstances and formed small communities
throughout the tundra. there is magic, it is *over*complicated and arcane
at times.
there used to be light on both sides of the planet,
hence why there are ancient ruins and dungeons still
littered about the frozen wasteland,
they are relics from a time long since passed.

the outcasts, living on the dark side of the planet, have to deal with the dungeons that the Ashari are 'oblivious' to. 
these dungeons are permanent and always producing monsters. to protect themselves, and subsequently the Ashari, from the dungeons, outcasts have created an system to pay and reward freelancers for keeping the monster population within dungeons in check.
dungeons, desite being dangerous, contain technological and/or magical relics. 
relics are constantly being researched in hopes of stopping the neverending cycle of dungeons

the "light-siders" are known as the Ashari.

gameplay:
overworld, towns, npcs, dungeons, monsters, combat, quests, etc.

temperature meter: your temperature is constantly dropping and you have to find ways to stay warm.
torches, fireplaces, campfires, body heat
use these to increase your temperature. don't bother implementing too hot because it's too cold lol.
you can use other players bodyheat, but it only works well if the other player isn't too cold.

characters:
stats, skills/traits/perks, hp, mp

quests:
though there is a main questline, it takes a backseat as the player gets
lost in the minutia of living in the tundra, doing busywork and incorporating
into the many small settlements dotted throughout the land.
