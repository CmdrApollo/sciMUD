spell is a class that implements a 'process' method that gets customized by the spell's parameters
    Class Spell = boilerplate spell. the spell parameters are the runes that compose it; when a spell gets made, 
    it .copy()'s the base class, then pickle's it into a file or database?
    Class Spell(runes: list[]):
        method process:
            runes -> return action
